    "1. Create a participation repo on GitHub and initialize with a README.\n",
    "1. Clone the repo to your local machine using GitHub desktop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, every time you want to work on the project:\n",
    "1. Sync the exiting master repo with your local repo on your computer (just in case a change was made by others). GitHub Desktop calls this operation a \"**fetch**\" and Git calls this a \"**pull**\".\n",
    "1. Work on the project in the local repo (on your computer).\n",
    "2. \"**Stage**\" the files to tell Git about those changes. GitHub Desktop automatically see changes made in the local repo. (Nice!)\n",
    "3. \"**Commit**\" to the changes to tell Git, \"yes, I want to do this, and what I did was \\[describe the changes\\]\". In GitHub Desktop, this means adding a short summary and (optionally) a longer description. \n",
    "4. You \"**fetch**\"/\"**pull**\" changes made on the master repo down to your local repo, in case other GitHub users (or you on a different machine) made changes while you were working on step # 1. If there are any conflicts, you'll be notified and prompted to fix them. \n",
    "5. You \"**push**\" the commited local changes to the master GitHub repo.\n",
    "- Git only pushes/tracks the _changes_ (called a _diff_) associated with a commit, so that it doesn't need to take a snapshot of all your files each time. \n",
    "\n",
